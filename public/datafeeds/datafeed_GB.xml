<p>This thermostat offers precise temperature control within the space. It allows a required temperature to be set and it will switch the heater on and off automatically in order to reach and maintain the set temperature.</p>
<p>The digital thermostat offers more accurate and precise control of the climate than the analogue thermostat. It is highly recommended for spaces where a precise temperature is required.</p>
<p>Master digital thermostats are accurate within 0.1℃ and have a vast working range between -10℃ and 70℃. The bright, readable display is capable of an accurate readout between -30℃ and 100℃.</p>
<p>The thermostat adds convenience, as it means that you do not need to keep switching your heater on and off. It also saves energy and money - as the heater will only operate when required, as opposed to operating constantly.</p>
<p>The 10m cable allows the thermostat to be placed a distance away from the heater, so it can be placed in a marquee or hall, even if the space heater is situated outside and the warm air is being ducted in.</p>
<p>The Master THD digital thermostat with 10m cable can be used with the Master range of direct oil fired heaters, indirect oil fired heaters, Air-Bus heaters, DC 61 heater, BLP ET (electronic) gas heaters, as well as CF 75, XL 61 and XL 91 heaters.</p>]]></summary><g:id><![CDATA[4150.134_GB]]></g:id><g:condition>new</g:condition><g:price>225.00 GBP</g:price><g:sale_price>215.00 GBP</g:sale_price><g:availability>in stock</g:availability><g:image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f7d8b8aaa5fe9.25996333.jpg</g:image_link><g:product_type><![CDATA[Accessories]]></g:product_type><g:google_product_category><![CDATA[Home & Garden > Household Appliances > Climate Control > Space Heaters]]></g:google_product_category><g:product_type><![CDATA[Master BV77 Indirect Space Heater Accessories]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Master BV110 Indirect Space Heater Accessories]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Master BV170 Indirect Space Heater Accessories]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Master BV290 Indirect Space Heater Accessories]]></g:product_type><g:mpn><![CDATA[4150.134]]></g:mpn><g:identifier_exists>TRUE</g:identifier_exists><g:brand><![CDATA[Master]]></g:brand></entry>

<h3>Large portable industrial heaters for construction sites, warehouses &amp; more</h3>
<p>The Thermobile IMA 61 is a large industrial space heater, designed for heating areas on construction sites, as well as warehouses, factories, agricultural buildings, large marquees &amp; events and more. As it is an indirect fired heater, it throws out only clean-fume free warm air, while fumes are exhausted out of the top of the unit. Lengths of ducting can be fixed to this heater in order to vent the warm air over long distances and into specific spaces, making it safe to heat confined spaces on site with little ventilation.</p>
<p>Two models of the Thermobile IMA 61 indirect space heater are available. The IMA 61 AX features an axial fan which offers up to 130 Pa pressure buildup, which allows it to be used with single lengths of ducting with few curves. The IMA 61 RAD features a radial fan which offers up to 250 Pa, which allows multiple lengths of ducting to be used, to send warm air to separate locations, further away from the heater.</p>
<p>This high quality diesel space heater is designed for industrial use. It offers large volumes of clean warm air, an air outlet temperature circa 40-60&deg;C, and it has a high efficiency heat exchanger offering 92% efficiency. The combustion chamber is heat resistant up to 850&deg;C and it features a tigerloop as standard - a fuel filter with condensate separator - as well as an intercal industrial burner with flowcontrol. This heater also has a thermostat connection point, which offers the capability to automatically switch the heater on and off as required in order to maintain a set temperature, saving on fuel and running costs, and adding convenience. The fan on this space heater stops at temperatures below 40 &deg;C, to prevent it from circulating cold air when starting up. Constant ventilation is also possible with an extra switch position.</p>
<p>Despite its industrial heating capabilities, the Thermobile IMA 61 indirect heater is also a convenient size. Its portable design, with large wheels and a handle, make it easy to move around a site and put into position, while the slim profile allows it to fit through door widths of 80cm.</p>
<p>Please note: This heater features no internal fuel tank. An external fuel tank is required.</p>]]></summary><g:id><![CDATA[41.722.800_GB]]></g:id><g:condition>new</g:condition><g:price>5995.00 GBP</g:price><g:sale_price>4,512.00 GBP</g:sale_price><g:availability>in stock</g:availability><g:image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f7db90abbdd86.74230659.jpg</g:image_link><g:google_product_category><![CDATA[Home & Garden > Household Appliances > Climate Control > Space Heaters]]></g:google_product_category><g:product_type><![CDATA[Indirect Fired Diesel Heaters]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Thermobile Industries BV]]></g:product_type><g:mpn><![CDATA[41.722.800]]></g:mpn><g:identifier_exists>TRUE</g:identifier_exists><g:brand><![CDATA[Thermobile]]></g:brand></entry>

You can choose the length of ducting you require using the drop-down menu above. You can also choose between a standard grid diffuser or a low level diffuser. The standard grid diffuser is a small box diffuser that fits on to the end of the ducting and acts as a vent that releases the warm air into the marquee or other space from one fixed point. The low level diffuser is a longer length diffuser which slides under the side of a marquee and vents the warm air into the space over a longer area. This provides more efficient distribution of the warm air. The thermostat allows you to pre-set a comfortable temperature that you would like the heater to reach.

<h2>The Complete Space Heater Package Deal</h2>
<h3>Everything you need for heating large marquees and events</h3>
<p>As part of the large marquee heater package deal, we supply a range of accessories which give you everything you need to heat multiple spaces or large spaces effectively. The marquee heating accessories included in our Dual Outlet Marquee Heater Package are: a two-way splitter, either 2 x 3m ducting or 2 x 7.6m ducting,&nbsp; 2 x standard grid diffuser or 2 x low level diffuser, as well as a thermostat, flue and rain cowl. The two-way splitter is designed to be fixed to the warm air outlet on the space heater and it features two separate outlets for the two sections of ducting. This allows you to send the warm air in two different directions, to heat multiple spaces or large spaces effectively.&nbsp;<span>You can choose the length of ducting you require using the drop-down menu above (3m or 7.6m). You can also choose between standard grid diffusers or low-level diffusers. The standard grid diffusers are small box diffusers that fit on to the end of the ducting and act as vents that release the warm air into the marquee or other space from one fixed point. The low level diffusers are longer length diffusers which slide under the sides of a marquee and vent the warm air into the space over a longer area. This provides more efficient distribution of the warm air. The thermostat allows you to pre-set a comfortable temperature that you would like the heater to reach. The marquee heater will only operate when the temperature drops below the temperature that you have pre-set and then it will switch itself off when that temperature has been reached.</span></p>

<p>The EPCARFIL30 Carbon Filter Drum is a paramount addition to your Ecor Pro dehumidifiers, specifically engineered to tackle and neutralize odours effectively. Ideal for environments where excess odours are a concern, this 30cm / 12" filter drum is not just a mere accessory but a necessity for maintaining a fresh and odour-free atmosphere. Its design and materials are chosen to ensure durability, efficiency, and environmental sustainability, making it a wise choice for both commercial and residential settings.</p>
<h4>Superior Filtration Technology</h4>
<p>At the heart of the EPCARFIL30 lies a dual-stage filtration system designed to maximize odour control. The initial stage features a PET pre-filter, made from Polyethylene Terephthalate, a clear, strong, and lightweight material that is 100% recyclable. This pre-filter captures large particulates, extending the life of the carbon filter. The core filtration is achieved through a cylindrical activated carbon filter, utilizing natural wood columnar activated carbon with an impressive iodine value of over 1000mg/g. This ensures even the strongest odours are absorbed efficiently before the air is dried.</p>
<h4>Designed for Durability and Ease of Use</h4>

The powerful airflow helps to evaporate moisture trapped within the walls, accelerating the drying process.</p>
<h3><strong>PROFESSIONAL DEHUMIDIFICATION</strong></h3>
<p>As the air circulates through the cavities, it collects moisture and carries it out of the walls via the connection hoses. The AERCUBE&reg; units work in conjunction with the Aerial ASE 300 dehumidifier to remove moisture from the air, preventing it from re-entering the walls and ensuring a dry climate.</p>
<p>Moisture and free water are suctioned and separated by the <strong>VT 2 Water Separator </strong>via the manifold hose system. This process is aided by the vacuum pressure generated by the <strong>VP 6 Turbine</strong>. The ASE 300 The two-stage <strong>HEPA Filtration System HF 2</strong> captures and removes dirt, bacteria and biomass, ensuring maximum hygiene to prevent room pollution and to protect each module throughout the process. Meanwhile, the <strong>SD 2 Sound Absorber</strong> is to be connected in order to minimise noise and disruption.

<h3>Efficient 45-litre boat dehumidifier</h3>
<p>The Ecor Pro DH3500 INOX is a compact desiccant dehumidifier designed for use on boats, ships, marine buildings and other challenging areas where the conditions can be extreme and diverse. The inside and outside stainless steel construction has double corners to give it greater impact resistance.

It also has an airflow volume capacity of 380m3/h, exhaust rate of 400m3/h, and a regenerated airflow rate of 125m3/h.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DH3500 INOX dehumidifier is portable, with robust steel handles for carrying. The handles can be removed for permanent installation into smaller spaces. The dehumidifier is made from marine grade stainless steel resistant to corrosion from saltwater and other chemicals. The internal and external parts are also heat-treated for strength and durability in demanding environments. The top cover is also easily removed and allows for access to the internal components or maintenance, repair and replacement to prolong the service life. There is also easy access to the reticulated foam dust filter, which can be removed and cleaned or replaced. The 220v 50Hz supply can be run off a 12v DC-220v AC converter or 110v to 220v transformers.</p>
<p>This efficient dehumidifier has a ductable system of 4 vents to help manage all climates, allowing it to dry enclosed areas without creating any air pressure while in operation. It can also be used as a 3 vent system, or a straightforward drier. It does not have an internal tank that needs to be emptied, and it can be left running continuously. An automatic reset function means that the dehumidifier will continue to run after an interruption to the power supply. The DH3500 INOX uses an advanced self-regulating energy usage system adapts to changing air pressure, ensuring only the right amount of power is consumed, reflective of the necessary drying capacity. It has an integrated humidistat and also features a connection port for a remote humidistat, which is useful if you install the dehumidifier in a place that is difficult to reach.</p>

<h3>Compact Solution with Advanced LGR Technology for Demanding Environments</h3>
<p>The Welsch WEL70-LGR Commercial LGR Dehumidifier is engineered to excel in challenging conditions, operating efficiently across a broad temperature range from 0&deg;C to 38&deg;C. Built to withstand rigorous environments such as water damage restoration sites and tough job locations, this adaptable dehumidifier can extract up to 70 litres of water per day, boasting a maximum airflow rate of 960m&sup3;/hr and operating humidity levels ranging from 26% to 99%. With a reasonable noise level of 72dB, it suits both residential and commercial applications, including flood damage restoration, renovation, and construction projects.</p>
<p>LGR, or low-grain refrigerant, technology lies at the heart of the Welsch WEL70-LGR. This high-performance LGR dehumidifier utilizes low-grain refrigeration to efficiently draw moisture from the air, even in low relative humidity situations. Employing a heat pipe precooling device, it captures warm air, cools it, then reheats and evaporates it consistently to eliminate moisture. Additionally, a robust, washable air filter captures dust and larger particles, enhancing overall air quality. Thanks to its efficient LGR technology and filter, this unit outperforms standard compressor dehumidifiers.</p>
<p>Equipped with a range of features to enhance functionality, the WEL70-LGR ensures prolonged, hands-free operation. Its time management feature allows users to easily switch between displaying current operating hours or total lifetime hours with a simple button press, aiding in usage monitoring and maintenance scheduling.</p>
<p>The unit features a built-in water pump and a 7.6-metre hose for automatic purging when the water tank reaches capacity, allowing for extended unattended operation. This cycle prevents overflow and temporarily halts unit operation until completion, minimizing potential water-related issues and enhancing user convenience. Additionally, a 4.6-metre power cord offers flexibility in unit placement, facilitating optimal positioning without constraints from power outlet proximity.</p>
<p>With an integrated humidistat, users can set and maintain desired humidity levels, while ice accumulation prompts the compressor's halt and blower engagement for ice removal. Error codes displayed on the control panel aid in quick issue identification, referencing the comprehensive list in the owner's manual.</p>
<p>Featuring a ductable configuration, the unit allows precise spot drying using a 7-inch diameter or wider lay flat duct, suitable for tented spaces to expedite drying. A large grip handle and two sizable wheels ensure effortless carrying, while the freestanding design permits stacking for convenient storage and transportation.</p>]]></summary><g:id><![CDATA[WEL70-LGR_GB]]></g:id><g:condition>new</g:condition><g:price>1150.00 GBP</g:price><g:sale_price>907.50 GBP</g:sale_price><g:availability>out of stock</g:availability><g:image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/65ddce4b134e11.93540559.jpg</g:image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/65ddce4b6b59a5.27643125.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/65ddce4b2f3791.43022125.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/65ddce4b8904c0.75186239.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/65ddce4ae823b3.04167760.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/65ddce4b4f4170.72609189.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:google_product_category><![CDATA[Home & Garden > Household Appliances > Climate Control > Dehumidifiers]]></g:google_product_category><g:product_type><![CDATA[Refrigerant Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Industrial Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:mpn><![CDATA[WEL70-LGR]]></g:mpn><g:identifier_exists>TRUE</g:identifier_exists><g:brand><![CDATA[Welsch Air Products]]></g:brand></entry>

There is no water tank, and any extracted water and melted ice will run out into a drain.</p>
<p>There are 2 models of the Calorex DH 60 available. The DH 60AX is a traditional refrigerant dehumidifier, while the DH 60AXP has the same specifications and features plus an inbuilt electric heater. The 4kW electric heater warms the room's air, allowing it to collect more moisture so the dehumidifier can work more efficiently, improve the ambient conditions, and reduce heating costs. It also helps to keep workers in the space warm on colder days. Both versions of the Calorex DH 30 commercial dehumidifier have tamper-proof controls so that they cannot be altered or adjusted by anyone other than authorised personnel.</p>
<p>The Calorex DH 60 is a robust commercial dehumidifier, with a polyester coated evaporator and condenser, and plastisol coated galvanised steel cabinet. The components effectively resist wear and corrosion to provide a long service life of excellent performance. The Calorex DH 30 dehumidifier is also very versatile and suitable for all year round use, as it has a wide operating temperature range of 0-35&deg;C.</p>]]></summary><g:id><![CDATA[Calorex DH 60_GB]]></g:id><g:condition>new</g:condition><g:price>3171.00 GBP</g:price><g:sale_price>2,793.00 GBP</g:sale_price><g:availability>out of stock</g:availability><g:image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5fc0ed438c9895.88979450.jpg</g:image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60c20edde246c3.86606252.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60c20edf9d1fe0.32592426.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60c20edfb83ee9.07624404.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60bf9918238149.42816503.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60c20ede144e24.22329177.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5fc0ed425f9592.23450350.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60c20f8508bef8.05756539.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60bf991877cea2.61052522.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5fc0ed40c2ea92.94444639.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5fc0ed3f857fb0.90651825.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:google_product_category><![CDATA[Home & Garden > Household Appliances > Climate Control > Dehumidifiers]]></g:google_product_category><g:product_type><![CDATA[Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Refrigerant Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Wall Mounted Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Commercial Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Industrial Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Calorex UK]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Cellar Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Classic Car Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Drying Room Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Factory Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:mpn><![CDATA[Calorex DH 60]]></g:mpn><g:identifier_exists>TRUE</g:identifier_exists><g:brand><![CDATA[Calorex]]></g:brand></entry>

<h3>Quick-drying dual-voltage dehumidifier for a range of applications</h3>
<p>The Master DHP55DV Industrial Dehumidifier is ideal for tackling flood and water damage thanks to its built-in discharge pump, which is fitted as standard for continuous drainage and means this dual-voltage dehumidifier can remove up to 46 litres in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>The DHP55DV dehumidifier boasts a corrosive-resistant rotomoulded body, built-in hydrostat, digital humidity sensor, control panel and automatic shut-off. Plus, there is the option to add a 5-litre water tank if you do not have access to a suitable drain.</p>
<p>An easy drying solution to install, operate, and manage in demanding areas of up to 160m&sup3; with a max airflow rate of 400m&sup3;/h, the Master DHP55DV dehumidifier work much like air conditioners. Warm moist air is drawn into the dehumidifier by a fan, crossing over refrigerant cooled coils and causing the moisture in the air to condense on the coils before being collected into a tank or drained externally for disposal.</p>
<p>Dehumidifiers are used for a number of applications and help reduce humidity levels, making you less hospitable to allergens, dust mites, mould and mildew and also help speed up the drying process of newly plastered rooms.</p>
<p>Used extensively following flooding or water damage, a dehumidifier will effectively remove excess moisture when placed in an affected room and used within its operating temperature range. Another great use for a dehumidifier is for drying plaster, allowing you to finish decorating the room even sooner. While a dehumidifier on its own can be very effective, it is worth considering using a heater and or an air mover or carpet dryer at the same time to speed the process.</p>]]></summary><g:id><![CDATA[4140.591_GB]]></g:id><g:condition>new</g:condition><g:price>1412.00 GBP</g:price><g:sale_price>1,403.00 GBP</g:sale_price><g:availability>in stock</g:availability><g:image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60ed4f50889da2.50224646.jpg</g:image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60ed4f51d9dfa6.72542197.png</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60ed4f5133ff83.68247010.png</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60ed4f51489474.16895246.png</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60ed4f504810d5.98307997.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60ed4f505dd272.28652863.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60ed4f507423d3.48547544.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/60ed4f503029d0.93726555.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:google_product_category><![CDATA[Home & Garden > Household Appliances > Climate Control > Dehumidifiers]]></g:google_product_category><g:product_type><![CDATA[Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Refrigerant Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Industrial Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Master Climate Solutions]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Construction Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Garage Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Warehouse Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Water Damage Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Workshop Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:mpn><![CDATA[4140.591]]></g:mpn><g:identifier_exists>TRUE</g:identifier_exists><g:brand><![CDATA[Master]]></g:brand></entry>

<h3>Robust 19-litre desiccant dehumidifier</h3>
<p>The Heylo AT20 19L industrial absorption dryer is a desiccant dehumidifier designed for tough environments where compressor dehumidifiers would struggle. It's particularly useful in areas with low temperatures and can remove up to 19 litres of moisture per day, making it great for water damage restoration, building and restoration work, and regulating humidity in various spaces like cellars, treatment plants, waterworks and more.</p>
<p>The AT20 dehumidifier is extremely versatile when it comes to drying purposes. It can be used for drying out cold construction sites or flood-damaged areas. In addition, it also manages the relative humidity in archives, storage rooms, basements and attics and prevents condensation, damp, mould and moisture damage to your storage items. In terms of manufacturing and production processes, the Heylo dehumidifier can be used for drying out materials and ingredients.</p>
<p>Despite its strong and sturdy construction, the Heylo absorption dryer has a compact design that makes it easy to transport, install and use in small and confined spaces. They're also easy to maintain and cost-effective to run due to the cutting-edge self-regulating PTC heating elements. The heating elements are energy-efficient, as they adjust their temperature and power consumption continuously based on the surrounding conditions. The AT20 dryer comes with attachment points for ducting to the air inlet, dry air outlet and wet air outlet. Besides, an external hygrostat can be utilised to set the desired relative humidity level within the space. The dehumidifier then automatically turns on and off to maintain the selected humidity level accordingly.</p>
<p>The dehumidifier employs an SSCR desiccant rotary wheel to extract moisture from the air efficiently. The high-performance rotor collects a considerable amount of excess moisture with the desiccant material. After absorbing moisture, the wheel undergoes heating from a PTC heating element, which causes the moisture to evaporate. The water vapour is then exhausted from the unit.</p>]]></summary><g:id><![CDATA[1110711_GB]]></g:id><g:condition>new</g:condition><g:price>1950.00 GBP</g:price><g:sale_price>1,815.94 GBP</g:sale_price><g:availability>out of stock</g:availability><g:image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/64413457d2d600.14293945.jpg</g:image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/64413870a47f97.57178441.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/6441387205dbb9.19931048.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/64413873cd1854.43621174.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:google_product_category><![CDATA[Home & Garden > Household Appliances > Climate Control > Dehumidifiers]]></g:google_product_category><g:product_type><![CDATA[Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Refrigerant Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Industrial Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Basement Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Cellar Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Construction Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Factory Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Loft Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Storage Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Water Damage Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:mpn><![CDATA[1110711]]></g:mpn><g:identifier_exists>TRUE</g:identifier_exists><g:brand><![CDATA[heylo]]></g:brand></entry>

<h3>Efficient 220W wall dryer suitable for both new &amp; old buildings</h3>
<p>The Heylo IRW200 is an infrared heating panel that has a power output of 220 watts. This wall dryer is effective in removing moisture from walls and blockwork after events such as floods, leaks, adverse weather and construction work, facilitating the drying of walls and building materials on construction sites. The Heylo heater is also suitable for use in new and old buildings, as well as for restoring buildings that have undergone fire or water damage. Apart from functioning independently to thaw and dry surfaces, the infrared heating panel can be used in combination with dehumidifiers and air mover fans to create a holistic drying system. Furthermore, the IRW200 can be used as a heating source in small cabins and trailers to keep people warm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Heylo IRW200 can gently yet effectively remove water and humidity damage using infrared heat. This heating panel is specifically designed to dry out moisture on walls with pinpoint accuracy. When using the infrared heat panel to dry plaster or wooden surfaces, it should be positioned at an appropriate distance from the surface and used with an airflow to avoid potential cracking or shrinkage. However, it is not recommended to use the panel heater to dry floors.</p>

<h3>Portable instant localised radiant heating</h3>
<p>The Broughton RG308 Infrared Heater is available in three models - 1.6kW, 2.8kW and 3kW heat capacities. These portable electric heaters can provide instant localised radiant heating in a range of different environments.</p>
<p>Infrared heaters offer a cost-effective and efficient heating solution in situations where heating an entire area is impractical, such as in warehouses, factories and other large industrial areas.</p>
<p>The Broughton RG308/13 is a 240v space heater capable of supplying 2.8kW of radiant heat, with a variable heat setting of just 1.4kW for when a lower level of heating is required. The radiant heat is produced by two sets of 1.4kW carbon fibre filaments, which are powered using a standard 240v 13A main supply and can be plugged into standard 240v wall sockets without the use of a transformer.</p>
<p>The Broughton RG308/16 is a 110v electric heater, which produces 1.6kW of radiant heat. The variable output settings allow you to select between 800w and 1.6kW of heating capacity depending on what is required to heat the area.</p>
<p>The Broughton RG308/32 is a 110v electric heater with a maximum heat output of 3kW, with a variable setting for just 1.5kW if needed. As the Broughton RG308/16 and RG308/32 are 110v pieces of equipment, they do require a transformer or designated 110v power supply to operate them.</p>
<p>The RG308 infrared heaters are ideal for most commercial and industrial applications, such as providing emergency heating in offices, schools, factories and building sites during colder periods.</p>
<p>Broughton RG308 carbon fibre quartz infrared heaters are lightweight at just 14kg and have a sturdy handle with lockable castors. They have an anti-tilt switch, which turns cuts out power if the heater accidently falls over.</p>]]></summary><g:id><![CDATA[Broughton RG308_GB]]></g:id><g:condition>new</g:condition><g:price>207.00 GBP</g:price><g:sale_price>180.00 GBP</g:sale_price><g:availability>in stock</g:availability><g:image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5dc57e703e5c00.43427329.jpg</g:image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5df75919bf6e79.50393156.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:google_product_category><![CDATA[Home & Garden > Household Appliances > Climate Control > Space Heaters]]></g:google_product_category><g:product_type><![CDATA[Infrared Heaters]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Broughton EAP]]></g:product_type><g:mpn><![CDATA[Broughton RG308]]></g:mpn><g:identifier_exists>TRUE</g:identifier_exists><g:brand><![CDATA[Broughton EAP]]></g:brand></entry>

<h3>Powerful 9kW industrial &amp; commerical space heater</h3>
<p>The Broughton FF13 is a 9kW portable three-phase electric space heater with a airflow rate of 1017m3/h, which is ideal for industrial and commercial applications on construction sites, factories, warehouses, temporary buildings, event marquees and more.</p>
<p>The Broughton FF13 industrial electric heater is a powerful piece of equipment that is effective for both heating and industrial drying. Electric fan heaters produce only clean, warm, odourless and fume-free air, so they are safe to use in enclosed spaces and insulated rooms.</p>
<p>The Broughton FF13 comes with a standard warm air outlet or with ducting spigots fitted. Ducting spigots provide a connection for 10m lengths of ducting, which can be used to direct the heat where it is required on site. You can opt to have a single 250mm ducting spigot fitted to your FF13 heater, or a double spigot with 2 x 150mm warm air outlets. The double spigot allows two 10 metre lengths of ducting to be fitted so that you can heat two separate areas simultaneously.</p>
<p>Designed and manufactured in the UK, the FF13 also features an adjustable thermostat mounted on the body of the heater, over temperature protection and significantly low noise production. They are safe to leave running unattended for short periods as the fail-safe will engage and shut down the heating element if the unit overheats.</p>
<p>An optional analogue remote thermostat is also available to add to your order. You can select the ducting spigot option you require using the drop-down menu above. You can also add ducting and a thermostat to your order using the tick boxes above. If you opt for the Single Spigot option, you should select 1 x 10m Aluminium Ducting (250mm). If you opt for the Double Spigot option, you should select 2 x 10m Aluminium Ducting (150mm).</p>
<p>Please note: The single and double spigot outlets are fitted to the fan heater prior to despatch. Please ensure you have selected the correct option from the drop down menu and have choosen the appropriate ducting from the tick box above before you complete your order. The Broughton FF13 must only be used with the manufacturer's aluminium ducting. Do not use this space heater with plastic flexible ducting or other accessories that are not approved by the manufacturer.</p>]]></summary><g:id><![CDATA[Broughton FF13_GB]]></g:id><g:condition>new</g:condition><g:price>350.00 GBP</g:price><g:sale_price>392.00 GBP</g:sale_price><g:availability>in stock</g:availability><g:image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5da9d0192282c3.95972198.jpg</g:image_link><g:google_product_category><![CDATA[Home & Garden > Household Appliances > Climate Control > Space Heaters]]></g:google_product_category><g:product_type><![CDATA[Electric Fan Heaters]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Broughton EAP]]></g:product_type><g:mpn><![CDATA[Broughton FF13]]></g:mpn><g:identifier_exists>TRUE</g:identifier_exists><g:brand><![CDATA[Broughton EAP]]></g:brand></entry>

<h2>Ecor Pro DH1200 220v Desiccant Dehumidifier</h2>
<h3>Highly compact 12 litre desiccant dehumidifier</h3>
<p>The Ecor Pro DH1200 is a desiccant dehumidifier that can remove up to 12 litres of moisture from the air over 24 hours. It is one of the smallest - and lightest - desiccant dehumidifier on the market at 280 x 190 x 190mm and weighing just 6.4kg. It has a 124m3/h air volume capacity and can be left to run continuously 24/7, making it suitable for residential use, but it also has the capacity for more robust applications.</p>
<p>The DH1200 has an operating temperature range of -20℃ to 40℃, but is also very quiet with a sound level of 52dB. This is ideal for home use and can be installed in garages, basements, laundry rooms, crawl spaces and more.It is also suitable for industrial units, workshops, drying rooms and various storage areas. Its wide operating temperature range makes it suitable for challenging unheated spaces where a refrigerant dehumidifier would be no use.</p>
<p>This Ecor Pro desiccant dehumidifier features a three vent system, which consists of 1 air inlet and 2 outlets. The inlet draws in the ambient air so that it can be dust filtered and dried by the desiccant material. One of the outlets expels this processed air back out into the space. The second wet air exhaust outlet ensures that the moisture is vented away and out of the room as water vapour. Optional flexible industrial ducting is available that attaches to these vents, in order to duct air in from the space and duct wet exhaust air outside.</p>
<p>The Ecor Pro DH1200 dehumidifier is an all-steel construction - inside and out, with a durable epoxy paint finish. All of the components are heat treated, while the reticulated dust filter can be easily cleaned or replaced. It has a sturdy carry handle that can be removed and replaced with a flat top lid if necessary for installation.</p>
<p>The DH1200 can be used as a free-standing dehumidifier or it can be installed at any angle. An integrated humidistat dial allows you to select a required humidity level in the space and the dehumidifier will switch on and off as required in order to maintain the set humidity level. There are four anti-scratch plastic feet, which swivel out to act as anchor points. The 5m power lead ensures that no extension leads or additional cables are needed if the dehumidifier is needed for awkward, confined spaces such as lofts, basements, under stairs or in cupboards.</p>
<p>Optional accessories are available for the DH1200 dehumidifier, including a remote humidistat that sets the required relative humidity level and will automatically switch the dehumidifier on and off - ideal if the dehumidifier is installed out of reach.</p>]]></summary><g:id><![CDATA[DH1200_GB]]></g:id><g:condition>new</g:condition><g:price>625.00 GBP</g:price><g:sale_price>535.00 GBP</g:sale_price><g:availability>in stock</g:availability><g:image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f4794e1a88.62658477.jpg</g:image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f4786255e7.32465563.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f479c61151.17098161.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f47a2ff464.59984490.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f478c92a22.06939839.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f477743ba8.52096634.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f477e03781.92049092.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f5b7a877ad759.68966320.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16cc95a99489.81479595.png</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f15aedfe53794.75685900.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f15aedebbaf83.83041731.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:google_product_category><![CDATA[Home & Garden > Household Appliances > Climate Control > Dehumidifiers]]></g:google_product_category><g:product_type><![CDATA[Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Desiccant Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Wall Mounted Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Domestic Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Commercial Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Industrial Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Ecor Pro]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Basement Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Cellar Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Classic Car Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:mpn><![CDATA[DH1200]]></g:mpn><g:gtin><![CDATA[5060224950999]]></g:gtin><g:identifier_exists>TRUE</g:identifier_exists><g:brand><![CDATA[Ecor Pro]]></g:brand></entry>

<h3>Compact 12 litre boat dehumidifier</h3>
<p>The Ecor Pro DH1200 INOX desiccant dehumidifier can remove up to 12 litres of moisture in a day and is one of the smallest marine dehumidifiers available. It has a 124m3/h air volume capacity and can run continuously 24/7.</p>
<p>The Ecor Pro DH1200 INOX is made from stainless steel - offering a level of resistance to corrosion caused by salt and chemicals. These dehumidifiers are suitable for use in boat cabins and other compartments to prevent the growth of damp, mould, bacteria and rot. They can be used for drying sails, ropes, equipment and clothes after they have been drenched in saltwater. They can also be used for a wide range of other drying applications in challenging unheated spaces.</p>
<p>Yachting World Magazine stated in its article about 'Best Boat Dehumidifiers' that "dehumidifiers are an essential investment to help protect the interior of a yacht over the winter months". It singled out the Ecor Pro DH1200 as the number one choice because it "delivered exceptional results all summer in tough environments such as Spitsbergen and Norway" and that "it is rare that we rate something this highly but the DryBoat 12 has proven to be a superb marine dehumidifier".</p>
<p>The Ecor Pro DH1200 is a small, compact unit weighing just 6.4kg and has an operating temperature range of -20℃ to 40℃. It has a 220v 50Hz supply that can be run off a 12v DC-220v AC converter or 110v to 220v transformers.</p>
<p>There are four anti-scratch plastic feet, which swivel out to act as anchor points. All components are heat treated to provide longevity. The reticulated dust filter can be cleaned or replaced. The cover can be removed quickly for access to parts for cleaning and servicing. An integrated humidistat allows automatic control of the dehumidifier, to maintain a set humidity level.`</p>
<p>The DH1200 INOX features three vents - 1 inlet and 2 outlets. Each of the three vents features an integrated flange, which can be used to attach optional flexible ducting. The inlet air and outlet dry air can be ducted using 125mm ducting. The wet air exhaust can be ducted using 45mm ducting, we include&nbsp;<span class="cf0">a FREE 1m x 45mm Flexible Ducting when you purchase this product</span>. The moisture is exhausted out of the back of the unit as water vapour, which can be vented outside through ducting.</p>
<p>Other accessories include a remote humidistat, which connects to the dehumidifier and can be used to set the required relative humidity level in the space. The humidistat will automatically switch the dehumidifier on and off as required to maintain the pre-set humidity level.</p>]]></summary><g:id><![CDATA[Ecor Pro DH1200 DryBoat Dehumidifier_GB]]></g:id><g:condition>new</g:condition><g:price>640.00 GBP</g:price><g:sale_price>610.00 GBP</g:sale_price><g:availability>in stock</g:availability><g:image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f52a70e862.46071356.jpg</g:image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f52af0bf64.21741033.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f529096ef6.66199605.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f529eb45b4.70495180.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f5286bb345.73472120.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f16f529765595.61230936.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f15aefcb836a9.39261523.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f15aefbd456e1.35856530.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f15aefc45baf5.21546712.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f5b764adcee14.52707917.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:additional_image_link>https://www.climatedry.co.uk/uploaded/public/5f5b764b583010.10678322.jpg</g:additional_image_link><g:google_product_category><![CDATA[Home & Garden > Household Appliances > Climate Control > Dehumidifiers]]></g:google_product_category><g:product_type><![CDATA[Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Desiccant Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Wall Mounted Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Boat Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Commercial Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Industrial Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Ecor Pro]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Drying Room Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Portable Dehumidifiers]]></g:product_type><g:product_type><![CDATA[Pharmaceutical]]></g:product_type><g:mpn><![CDATA[Ecor Pro DH1200 DryBoat Dehumidifier]]></g:mpn><g:gtin><![CDATA[5060224951033]]></g:gtin><g:identifier_exists>TRUE</g:identifier_exists><g:brand><![CDATA[Ecor Pro]]></g:brand></entry>

<h3>Exceptional energy-efficiency per extraction litre</h3>
<p>The Ecor Pro EPD100LGR is a small low grain refrigerant dehumidifier. It is an industrial product that is ideal for drying after restoration, renovation, construction and other demanding applications. LGRs continue to remove water from a space even when the relative humidity is very low. This level of performance is what makes them so suited to flood recovery and trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use the&nbsp;<span>EPD100LGR</span> dehumidifier continuously. It has an operating temperature range of 4&deg;C to 38&deg;C and a maximum extraction rate of 43 litres. It also has a single fan speed of 330m&sup3;/hr, offering consistency and reliability at all times. There is also an automatic restart function, which ensures that the dehumidifier will restart in the event of a power outage, making it ideal for use in areas with frequent power cuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ecor Pro EPD100LGR uses an integrated water pump that can lift to 3.5 metres and comes with a 12-metre push-fit drainage hose. You can use it to draw moisture out of basements and trenches as easily as you can from ground level spaces. You can also duct the side air outlet, allowing for focused spot drying, and use it in tented areas for faster drying times.&nbsp;There is a replaceable carbon filter protected by a tough aluminium frame that is wipe clean and lockable in position. It captures dust and other particles, ensuring that the air is clean and healthy to breathe.</p>
<p>The roto-moulded plastic body is robust and durable. It does not rust, and you can easily remove the panels to access the drain tray, pump, and all components for servicing. The outer casing is designed to be impact-resistant and durable, providing protection to its internal components and being able to withstand collisions.&nbsp;This industrial dehumidifier is freestanding, with four rubber feet for stability. The low profile design is designed for stacking, which is ideal for transport and storage. There are grip handles on either side of the machine and two integrated wheels for easy carrying and dragging.</p>
<p>The Ecor Pro EPD100LGR low grain dehumidifier is user-friendly. It has a front panel with electronic controls and a clear readout. From here, you can adjust and view all the modes and available information. This Ecor Pro dehumidifier is energy efficient with optimum compressor operating times based on an internal microprocessor calculation to optimise performance. With the intuitive panel, you can control the humidistat, water purge, and other functions. The built-in humidistat offers easy monitoring and adjustment of the humidity levels. In addition, you can see input and output humidity and temperature readings, run time hours, power consumption, coil temperature, and more.</p>

<h3>Dual-voltage professional dehumidifier with auto condensate pumpout</h3>
<p>The Dri-Eaz BD1000 building dryer is an efficient and versatile dehumidifier that can remove up to 48-litres of moisture from the air per day. It is ideal for a range of applications, such as wet trade drying, construction remodelling, flood and fire restoration, humidity control, and more. The BD1000 is a robust unit with a hybrid construction that features an impact-resistant, rotomoulded cover over a steel chassis. The polyethylene housing does not rust or dent, it is easy to clean, and it has curved edges to prevent accidental damage. The Dri-Eaz BD1000 is also incredibly lightweight and portable, with a compact size, robust handle, integrated moving skids, and semi-pneumatic wheels for easy transportation.</p>
<p>The Dri-Eaz BD1000 dehumidifier is a dual voltage appliance that automatically switches between its voltage settings depending on its power source. This voltage feature means you can use both 110-120v and 220-240v power supplies for convenience. It is a user-friendly dehumidifier with a rotary on/off switch and humidistat. The BD1000 also has an automatic condensate pump out that extracts water via a 12.2m drainage hose, to a height of 2m, so that you can leave it running unattended. You can pump water into any sink, toilet, drain, or container. A flush-mounted hour counter helps to plan maintenance schedules, and an on-board kilowatt-hour meter provides accurate power consumption readings.</p>
<p>The Dri-Eaz BD1000 building dryer has an anti-clog design that reduces any build-up of dirt and grime for better performance in dusty environments and reduces the cleaning and maintenance requirements. If you need to access the internal parts, fast opening hinges allow the housing to be lifted easily.
